Quick Data is a small JavaScript library which focuses on providing a quick and fast bridge between data inputs, and data outputs. 

 - Inlets provide input functionality. Currently any html input element can be used
 - Outlets provide output functionality. Any DOM element can be linked by id, and class.
 - the javascript object also holds the base data value which can be used on the JavaScript side.

This library is being continuously updated.
